### Quick Intro

I am a ***fullstack javascript developer*** and Tech Lead at [QuezX.com](//quezx.com "QuezX.com"). I started working at *QuezX* from June, 2015.

I hold a <acronym title="Bachelor of Technology">B.Tech.</acronym> degree in electrical engineering from *Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee*.


### Why start a blog ?

Why not start a blog?
  - It will be a new learning.
  - It helps me think clearer.
  - It will help me write better.
  - It makes me immortal.

And, [many more..](//howtostartablogonline.net/why-blog/).

### What is with handle *yogesum* ?
It is made by this equation [*yogesh* **+** *sum* = *yogesum*].

In Sanskrit ***Yogesh*** mean *Lord of enlightened souls*, and ***Sum*** in english means *addition* which is a synonym to Sanskrit word **Yog**.

The act of addition itself is *"**yog**"*. So, I added both words to make my handle.
